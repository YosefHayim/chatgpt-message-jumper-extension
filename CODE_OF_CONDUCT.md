This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (code, issues, pull requests, discussions)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

## Specific Guidelines for AI Conversation Navigator

### Code Review Etiquette

When reviewing pull requests:

1. **Be constructive**: Suggest improvements, don't just point out problems
2. **Be specific**: Provide examples and explanations
3. **Be timely**: Review PRs within a reasonable timeframe
4. **Be appreciative**: Thank contributors for their work
5. **Be respectful**: Remember there's a person behind the code

Example of good feedback:
```
Great work on the navigation feature! I have a suggestion:

Instead of:
if (index < 0 || index > total) return;

Consider:
if (index < 0 || index >= total) {
  console.warn('Invalid index:', index);
  return;
}

This would fix the off-by-one error and provide better debugging.
```

### Issue Reporting Etiquette

When reporting bugs or requesting features:

1. **Search first**: Check if the issue already exists
2. **Be descriptive**: Provide clear steps to reproduce
3. **Be patient**: Maintainers may not respond immediately
4. **Be helpful**: Offer to contribute a fix if possible
5. **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused on the issue

### Testing and Quality

Contributors are expected to:

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure tests pass before submitting PRs
- Test on multiple platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Document any known limitations
- Not submit code they know is broken
